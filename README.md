# Prism Release Application

## Description

This is a prototype application to help facilitate the release process here at Proofpoint. The application is aware of the Perry Environment, and provides an abstraction layer to help engineering manage:

1. Environments
2. Release Gates
3. Releases

These are the core concepts of promoting releases within the Software Development Lifecycle. More on these concepts will be presented later in this README doc.
